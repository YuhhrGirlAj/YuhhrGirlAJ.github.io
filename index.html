        <p>Yo! My name's Adriana Georgescu. I decided to attend the program for coding to learn the fundamentals of coding, so I can use the basics to grow on in college.
          In the duration of the program, I learned a range of programming skills. Each are listed below as a link that will take you to my completed projects.
          This website in fact is a concluded look at what I learned. I like watching DC and Marvel tv series and anything else that includes mystery
          and action. My favorite food is enchiladas. Drink, Horchata, and I love coffee with cake. As you can see, I love Harley Quinn because she is nuts and unique.</p>
